## Noising Intermediate Activations as a Measure of Feature Importance  

This repo contains the code I used for one of the projects I worked on during the [CHERI Research Fellowship](https://www.xrisk.ch/research-fellowship) under the mentorship of Marius Hobbhahn. We decided to abandon this research direction 
after gathering evidence that noising intermediate activations was not a reliable measure of feature 
importance even in extremely toy settings (1-layer MLPs). At some point I may create a write-up at some 
point explaining the results of the project. I have made no effort to polish the code for 
public presentation, so I wouldn't reccomend reading it.
